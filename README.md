# IncomeTax
The income tax table employs PostgreSQL for data storage and management incorporating procedural queries to facilitate complex calculations, analyses, and data processing. This database system enables efficient storage of taxpayer information, leveraging procedural language capabilities for tasks such as tax calculations, compliance checks, and analytics. The use of PostgreSQL ensures data integrity, scalability, and the ability to implement advanced features, such as triggers and stored procedures, contributing to a robust income tax management system.
